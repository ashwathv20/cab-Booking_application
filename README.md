# cab-Booking_application
It's a beginner-friendly Java OOPS project which I have done for my JAVA course in my 3rd Semester.

- here I made different classes to work on their specific work and using oops concepts they may inherit the common customer details.
- the classes where cab,vehicle booking which consist of inner classes like trip and booking and a Costumer class
